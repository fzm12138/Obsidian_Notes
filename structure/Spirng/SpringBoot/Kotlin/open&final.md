#### Final
- In Java,*we use final to declare* 
	- a function can't be override
	-  a class can't be extended
- In Kotlin,final is the **default option**  *we use open to declare*
	- a function could be override
	- a class can be extended
- So,`open`in Kotlin is exactly the oppsite of `final`in Java
